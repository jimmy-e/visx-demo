fix issue where if you click on bar, it has no shading and instead disappears ... was this the 
pattern i deleted in the example controls?

make util for animated vs unanimated packages

what are the xychart props that are remaining?

create common props for all shapes ... e.g. accessors, data, etc

make isAnimated prop false by default

add lazy loading

make library agnostic to sample data, such as accessors, etc
